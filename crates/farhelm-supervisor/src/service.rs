//! The supervisor service: farhelm-proto over a unix socket.
//!
//! This is the only doorway to sessions — the helm (local or via the ssh
//! stdio proxy) and every future caller speak the same protocol to the
//! same handlers, which is what keeps "CLI flags bypass the creation UI,
//! never the creation API" true. The supervisor listens on no network
//! port (SPEC.md): the unix socket plus ssh exec is the entire reachable
//! surface.
//!
//! M2 scope: SQLite (`crate::store`) is the truth that a session exists
//! and what its metadata is, written at creation and reloaded at startup
//! so sessions survive a supervisor restart. tmux stays the truth for
//! whether a session's terminal is currently alive; a session whose own
//! tmux session no longer exists — whether because the whole private tmux
//! server did not survive a restart, or because just that one session was
//! killed independently — is still listed (metadata came back from the
//! DB) but loses its terminal handle — see `SessionEntry`'s `terminal`
//! field and the `Attach`/`Resize` handlers' handling of `None`.
//! PLAN_M2.md's "restart gap" paragraph is the contract; M3 replaces this
//! crude exited-unknown answer with real interrupted classification.
