//! What a session's status SAYS: the badge every surface renders it as, and
//! the consequence sentence a delete confirmation opens with.
//!
//! Both are pure `SessionStatus` -> text mappings with no renderer and no
//! I/O, which is what lets them be pinned by unit tests here rather than only
//! through the browser. The status itself, and the predicates that ask about
//! it (`SessionStatus::is_live` / `has_ended`), live in `lib.rs` next to the
//! wire type — this module is about wording, never about deciding what a
//! status means.
//!
//! ## Why the wording is not left to each call site
//!
//! Two surfaces render a session's status: the list's rows, and the session
//! view's own header — which shows the same badge behind a stale session's
//! notice (SPEC.md's "title, directory, last-known status"). A second copy of
//! the mapping would let one surface describe a session differently from the
//! other, and the difference would be invisible until a user compared the two
//! screens for the same session.
//!
//! The confirmation wording carries more than consistency: it is the one
//! sentence standing between a click and an irreversible delete, and SPEC.md's
//! no-guessing rule constrains it directly — `Unknown` must admit uncertainty
//! rather than borrow `Alive`'s claim, and `Interrupted`/`Error` must not
//! promise to kill something that is already gone. Those are the assertions
//! the tests at the bottom exist for.

/// truncatable element instead — a legal title can be tens of KB with no
/// whitespace at all, and the earlier single-string design (title
/// embedded mid-sentence, the whole thing ellipsized as one span) would
/// clip whichever half landed at the tail once a title ran long enough,

/// `on_delete`, which sends every `has_ended()` status straight to the

/// because `confirming` is `ListView`'s own state, decoupled from any single
/// render: a session that was `Alive` when the user opened this prompt
/// can flip to `Exited` under it (stopped from another client, say)
/// before either button is clicked, and this function re-runs on every
/// render off whatever status the row's LATEST prop carries. The
/// `Exited`, `Interrupted`, AND `Error` arms are all that residual case's
/// fallback, not wordings SPEC.md's confirm-contract actually specifies —
/// and `Error` is not merely a defensive completeness case: a session
/// that was genuinely `Alive` when this prompt opened, whose agent then
/// turns out never to have execed at all (the launch shim's sentinel is
/// read only once the pane goes dead-or-absent — `service.rs`'s
/// dead-or-absent gate), can flip straight from `Alive` to `Error` under
/// an already-open prompt exactly like the `Exited` case above, just with
/// a narrower window.
///
/// `Interrupted`'s wording is deliberately NOT a killing warning
/// (PLAN_M3.md item 2): the status exists only because the HOST rebooted,
/// which took the agent and every descendant of it with it, so there is
/// nothing left for a delete to kill and claiming otherwise would be the
/// mirror image of the fabricated-liveness mistake `Unknown`'s wording
/// exists to avoid. What deleting actually costs is the session itself —
/// worth saying, because an interrupted session is the one case where the
/// record outlives everything it described and is all that is left to
/// lose (and, since restart landed, the only route back into that
