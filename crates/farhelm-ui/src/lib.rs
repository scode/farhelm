//! The Farhelm UI: one Dioxus component tree, two targets.
//!
//! The same components render as the web app (wasm32, real DOM, served
//! by the helm at loopback) and the desktop app (wry webview). The
//! terminals themselves are xterm.js islands (assets/terminal.js) whose
//! byte paths bypass Dioxus entirely — Dioxus owns the chrome around a
//! terminal, never its content (SPEC_impl.md, "Terminal widget"). A
//! session view holds SEVERAL of those islands at once, all attached
//! concurrently (terminal tabs, PLAN_M4.md); tabs multiply the
//! boundary's instances, never the boundary itself (see [`SessionView`]).
//!
//! Data fetching uses reqwest, which works on both native (desktop) and
//! wasm (browser fetch) — one code path, no per-target HTTP client.
//!
//! ## Navigation (M2, PLAN_M2.md step 7)
//!
//! `App` holds `Signal<Option<Session>>` rather than pulling in a router
//! crate: `None` renders [`ListView`], `Some(session)` renders
//! [`SessionView`] plus a back control that clears the signal.
//! PLAN_M2.md named a premature router as a risk to avoid — two states
//! and one signal cover everything needed so far, and a router can still
//! be introduced when something actually demands one. Terminal tabs did
//! not: a tab selection is view-local state, not a location, and nothing
//! links to a specific tab.
//!
//! ## Module layout
//!
//! This file keeps only what every module needs: the wire-mirror types
//! (`Session`, `SessionStatus`, `RestartOffer`, `Tab`), the `ApiBase`
//! context type, and `App` itself. Everything else is split by concern so
//! each piece can be read (and tested) without the others' unrelated
//! details in view:
//!
//! - `api`: every `async fn` that calls the helm's HTTP API, the
//!   response-shape types those calls decode, the URL-building helpers,
//!   and the shared poll cadence both pollers below use.
//! - `list`: [`ListView`], `SessionRow`, and `CreateSessionForm` — the
//!   session list and its lifecycle actions.
//! - `tabs`: the tab-domain half of terminal tabs (PLAN_M4.md item 6) —
//!   the renderer-free derivations (which tabs to show, their labels and
//!   DOM ids, the WebSocket path) plus the strip's one presentational
//!   piece, `TabStripItem`, and the close-confirmation wording.
//! - `rename`: `RenameForm`, the one control both rename surfaces share
//!   (PLAN_M5.md item 6) — a single-line field that sends what the user
//!   typed verbatim, with the request, the optimistic paint, and the
//!   refusal text left to whichever surface mounted it.
//! - `attachments`: the attachment domain of paste/drop interception
//!   (PLAN_M4.md item 7) — the classification rule, the naming rule, the
//!   upload endpoint, and the wording of every message a transfer can put
//!   on screen, serialized into the page for terminal.js to apply (see
//!   that module's header for why the runtime path cannot live in Rust).
//! - `session_view`: [`SessionView`] itself, the stateful component that
//!   owns one session's terminals, restart affordance, and tab lifecycle,
//!   calling into `api` for I/O and `tabs`/`attachments` for the pure
//!   derivations.
//!
//! All six are private modules with `pub(crate)` entry points: nothing
//! outside this crate has a legitimate reason to reach into any of them,
//! so `main.rs` only ever sees `App`/`ApiBase`, both defined and exported
//! here.
