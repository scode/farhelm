// =====================================================================
// Multi-host: the hosts panel, the stale list, and host management
// (PLAN_M6.md item 6).
//
// The stack Playwright drives is a two-host FLEET (see start-stack.sh):
// the helm's own machine as the reserved local row, plus a second real
// supervisor on an isolated state directory registered as an
// ssh-to-localhost "remote". Everything below drives that fleet for real
// — a killed supervisor, a genuinely re-registered host — with a set of
// deliberate exceptions that use `page.route` instead, each noted at the
// test that takes it: the local host's not-running state (provoking it for
// real would mean stopping the developer's own supervisor), the identity
// states (provoking those for real means wiping and reinstalling a
// supervisor mid-suite; the helm-side contract for them is pinned in Rust,
// and what is left to prove here is the RENDERING — `identity-mismatch-
// surfaced` — and the request body — `adopt-requires-current-identity`,
// which is the one that actually sends an adoption), the full phase table
// (seven of its
// nine phases have no cheap real cause), and the create dialog's
// vanishing-selection case.
//
// SKIPPING is decided by an INDEPENDENT self-ssh probe, never by "the host
// did not connect" — see `selfSshAvailable`. The distinction is the
// difference between skipping a precondition this suite may not create and
// skipping the bugs it exists to catch. In CI, where self-ssh is
// provisioned, an absent fleet FAILS (`requireFleet`).
//
// Nothing here reads terminal scrollback. Keeping these tests in their own
// file also contains their deliberate fleet mutations behind this file's
// reset and restoration hooks.
