// other keystroke, landing on `basic`'s pty in its ordinary canonical/cooked
// mode (nothing here puts it in raw mode, unlike the `hexecho` fixture the
// Rust e2e suite uses for byte-exact coverage of every mangled control byte,
// including ESC/arrow-up).
//
// ArrowUp is deliberately NOT exercised here, after checking what a
// canonical-mode pty actually does with it: Linux's ECHOCTL local-echo
// renders ANY control byte with no special canonical role — ESC included —
// as two-character caret notation ("^["), regardless of whether it arrived
// as a genuine 0x1b byte or as the bug's literal caret text. The pane's
// rendered output is identical either way, so `basic`'s canonical pty gives
// no browser-observable signal for ESC at all; that gap is exactly what
// `hexecho`'s raw mode (no ECHOCTL, no canonical processing) exists to
// close, and the Rust e2e suite's `input_bytes_survive_verbatim_through_hexecho`
// covers it directly.
//
// Backspace escapes that trap because DEL, unlike ESC, has a special
// canonical-mode role: a correctly delivered 0x7f is consumed as the ERASE
// character (removing the previous character, never echoed as text at
// all), while the bug's mangled delivery is two ordinary printable
// characters that erase nothing and sit in the buffer as literal `^?`. That
// gives a real positive/negative pair to assert on, checked below.
//
// Ctrl+C escapes it differently: ECHOCTL still renders a correctly
// delivered ETX as "^C" text, so the caret text alone proves nothing. What
// DOES distinguish the two is what happens next — a correct ETX is also
// consumed as INTR, raising SIGINT on the fake agent's foreground process
// group and killing it (default disposition; `basic` installs no handler),
// while the bug's mangled two-character delivery is inert text that leaves
// the process running. So the assertion below is "the pane no longer echoes
// new input", not "no ^C text appeared" — and it must reject the marker
// appearing ANYWHERE on an echoed line, not just as an exact substring: a
// mangled ctrl-c leaves the buffered "x" (see below) sitting in canonical
// input, so a later Enter would flush "x" plus the marker together as one
// line, echoing as `echo:x^Cpost-ctrlc-marker` — which a bare
// `.not.toContain("echo:post-ctrlc-marker")` would miss entirely, since
// that exact substring never occurs even though the marker plainly reached
// the (still-alive, still-buggy) agent.
//
// This does NOT end the tmux session, despite ending the fake-agent
// process: `remain-on-exit on` (SPEC.md) keeps a dead pane's session and
// window around so its terminal stays viewable, it just stops accepting
// input. Killing the agent is still sufficient for the assertion, and is
