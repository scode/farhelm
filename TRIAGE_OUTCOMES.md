# Triage outcomes

## abandon-upload-waits-unboundedly.md

- Outcome: `fix spec`.
- Assessment: confirmed by current-code inspection, not runtime reproduction. Supervisor upload cleanup awaits blocking
  filesystem removal without a deadline (`crates/farhelm-supervisor/src/service/uploads.rs`, `abandon_upload`). A
  refused commit can hold the session lifecycle claim during that wait, and teardown waits for upload completion. The
  helm's affected upload request can remain pending, but its reply wait releases the shared request-map lock and does
  not block a runtime thread. No existing spec provision was found that explicitly accepts filesystem hangs. This
  inspection establishes the request's asynchronous wait, not an exhaustive proof of host isolation under filesystem
  failures.
- Decision: assume each host's local filesystem is healthy. Local filesystem I/O errors or hangs are allowed to halt
  progress or cause failures, and do not justify added recovery complexity as long as the impact is localized to the
  host whose filesystem is broken. The helm must continue to function: one remote host must not freeze or break the
  helm. This applies to the supervisor host's filesystem, not only the machine running the helm.
- Completion criteria: update the authoritative specs to state this general operating assumption and host-isolation
  boundary, rather than suppressing only this finding. No code or implementation-comment changes are part of this
  spec-only outcome. Do not treat permission for host-local failure as permission for a remote host to freeze or break
  the helm; if execution finds such a cross-host effect, surface it to the user rather than silently broadening this
  outcome. Delete the feedback file and its `review_feedback_queue/INDEX.md` entry in this item's execution PR.
- Execution: `complete`; applied immediately under the spec-only triage rule. jj change:
