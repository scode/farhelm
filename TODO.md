# TODO

A running list of things the maintainer wants fixed or built. This is intent, not history: an entry is REMOVED in the
same PR that addresses it, so the file only ever describes what is still wanted. It is not a roadmap and carries no
priorities unless an entry says so itself.

Four buckets, assigned by the maintainer: "definite simplification" is complexity the maintainer has decided to remove —
the decision is made, only the work remains; "near term" is what should be picked up next; "maybe later" is wanted but
not soon, and may never happen; "unbucketized" is everything not yet sorted, which carries no implication either way.
Within a bucket, no order.

## Definite simplification

## Near term

- Deflake `agent_relay::a_helm_that_dies_mid_upcall_ends_the_request_at_once` (crates/farhelm/tests/e2e). Fingerprint:
  `the supervisor never answered the agent request: Elapsed(())` from the peer's 20 s `answer()` budget, panicking at
  the `answer()` expect. It is a load flake that predates the profiles/host-list stack: on 2026-09-02 a 4-vCPU sandbox
  running the e2e binary alone at `--test-threads=4` hit it in 2 of 5 runs on main and 3 of 7 on that stack's tip, while
  16 runs alone (`cargo test -p farhelm --test e2e <name> -- --exact`) passed on both, and every local run on a 6-core
  machine passed. Never yet seen on a GitHub runner, but the release workflow's build gate runs this suite, so it is a
  tag-build risk. First suspect is the budget or the helm-death detection racing the request under load, not the relay
  itself. Climb `.agents/narrow-tests.md`'s ladder from rung 3 (rung 1 does not reproduce) with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` and
  the supervisor log, and either fix the latency or widen the oracle the way #299 did for its siblings.
- Deflake `terminal_backpressure::a_paused_replay_detaches_relative_to_the_first_pause_despite_pause_spam`
  (crates/farhelm/tests/e2e). Failed once on a GitHub runner (CI run 33613878036, 2026-09-02, panicking at
  terminal_backpressure.rs:289) in the `test` job for a PR that touched nothing on the terminal path, and passed on the
  rerun. The test predates that PR. No local or sandbox reproduction has been attempted; start at rung 3 of
  `.agents/narrow-tests.md` on a 4-vCPU box, since a single CI sighting says "load", not "logic".

## Maybe later

- Automate end-to-end testing of the host UPDATE path, including across releases. Nothing in CI updates a host: the
  CentOS provisioning test only ever installs onto a fresh container, and the update flow's own tests drive fake
  backends. The gap shipped a real field failure (2026-09-01), which is the worked example any design here should be
  checked against: the first cross-protocol update ever attempted — a protocol-12 farhelm 0.1.1 host under a protocol-14
  0.2.1 helm — failed at the PROBE, whose classifier treated the version-skew refusal as a transport failure ("the
  supervisor probe closed before hello completion with exit status 0"), making exactly the host the update action exists
  for un-updatable; the operator recovered by stopping the remote supervisor by hand so the probe would see clean
  absence and take the fresh-install path. The eventual fix (`ProbeObservation::SkewedSupervisor`) added unit and
  service-level regression tests, but the CLASS of bug wants end-to-end coverage: something like a CentOS-leg variant
  that provisions a PREVIOUS RELEASE's binary (the harness builds its payloads from this tree today; the helm's own
  verified release-download path — D13, `release_payloads.rs` — is the existing machinery that can fetch a pinned
  released one), lets it register and run, then drives the panel's update action to the workspace build and asserts the
  supervisor comes back at the new version with its tmux sessions intact. The old half must be a real released artifact,
  not this tree's build — same-version update tests are exactly what could never see this bug.

- Guard provisioning against pushing payloads older than the helm's own protocol. A release-shaped helm built from a
  commit newer than the latest release (the local stable-binary flow does exactly this) provisions remote hosts with
  DOWNLOADED released payloads by default (D13), so the freshly provisioned supervisor can speak an older protocol than
  the helm that just installed it — and the helm then refuses it at the hello gate. Nothing is damaged (the refusal is
  the version rule working), but the failure arrives one step late, as a skewed host instead of a refused provisioning
  attempt. Possible shapes: compare the payload's version against the helm's `PROTOCOL_VERSION` before pushing and
  refuse with a message naming the mismatch; or make the staged-payload path (`--payload-dir`,
  `FARHELM_HELM_PAYLOAD_DIR`) the documented answer for from-main helms. Noted 2026-08-31 when upgrading the stable
  install to a from-main build while the newest release was still 0.1.1.

- Custom hover tooltips on buttons and menu items. Native `title` tooltips are free (the UI already uses them on the
  activity time, the cwd line, the profile chip and the header's archive button) but the browser owns their ~1s delay
  and nothing — no CSS, attribute, or JS — shortens it; WebKit's web content ignores the macOS tooltip-delay default
  too. A faster, themed tooltip is a component shown on hover after a delay of the app's own choosing (~300ms), and it
  has to escape the sidebar: `.app-sidebar`'s `overflow: hidden auto` clips anything anchored inside a row near its
  edges, so the tooltip needs a body-level portal or `position: fixed` with measured coordinates — the row `…` menu's
  popover is the pattern to copy. If the native delay turns out tolerable, a `title` pass over the terse actions (stop /
  archive / delete, the host row's buttons) is an hour and needs none of this.

- Consider dropping conversation-identity SCAN support and keeping only the per-launch hook. The resume promise stays;
  what goes is the second mechanism. The hook is the agent's own answer and covers `/clear` and `/new`, which the scan
  cannot see at all; the scan (`agent_kind/capture.rs`, `service/capture.rs`, and their e2e suites — roughly 6k lines)
  exists only for launches where the hook cannot be attached (a profile already passing `--settings` or Codex hook
  config, a bare `--`, or `FARHELM_AGENT_HOOKS` opting out) and for a hook that failed. Those launches would take the
  fallback SPEC.md already defines for an uncaptured identity — restart says so and offers the resume template or a
  fresh launch — and the vendor-record parsing that breaks whenever a vendor changes its on-disk layout goes away. The
  spec edit is one clause in Durability and resume ("and scanned from the outside … otherwise", plus "Scanning stays the
  fallback …"). Write-up: https://claude.ai/code/artifact/554790ce-c744-4daa-b9a5-151facdb1f42

- Consider dropping the race-proofing around host identity, keeping the identity itself. To be clear about what stays:
  the per-install identity the supervisor mints on first run and stores in its own database, independent of hostname and
  address, so a retargeted row or a state directory moved to another machine is recognized as the same install; "never
  silently merge" as a user-visible rule; and the mismatch surfaced with both identities and an adopt choice. What goes
  is the machinery that closes millisecond windows in RECORDING it: the empty-slot-only compare-and-swap in
  `record_first_contact`, the dialed-configuration check inside the same transaction (a retarget straddling a
  handshake), the separate adopt CAS with in-transaction cache purge, the never-reused connection tokens that every
  session-cache and mutation write carries, and the split of one "something is off" situation into three connection
  states (`identity-mismatch`, `duplicate`, `identity-unverified`) each with its own remedy text and re-probe policy —
  about 1,500 lines of helm implementation plus ~2,000 of tests across `store.rs`, `manager.rs`, and `hosts.rs`. The
  replacement is check-and-ask: on connect, compare the reported identity with the stored one; equal or empty means
  record and proceed, different means freeze and ask. The races it stops defending against need a retarget or a second
  first-contact to land within one handshake of another, and even then the consequence is a wrong identity the next
  connect flags as a mismatch, not a merge nobody sees. SPEC_impl.md's "structurally impossible at the storage layer"
  and "SCHEMA invariant" paragraphs under Helm internals would be rewritten to say the check is a check. Write-up:
  https://claude.ai/code/artifact/c3d3a74b-ae55-45c7-b3ca-fe30f9f97432

- Replace `install.sh`'s park/journal/rollback with plain idempotency. The floor to keep: re-running the installer from
  ANY intermediate state converges to a correct install, and no single binary is ever torn — download and extract into a
  staging directory inside `$INSTALL_DIR`, verify, then `mv` each binary into place, which is an atomic rename on one
  filesystem. Keep the outer brace group too; it is two lines and is what makes a truncated `curl | sh` execute nothing.
  What goes is the transactional layer built on top of that: the `mkdir` lock with ownership checks, the
  `PARK`/`INSTALL`/`UNDONE` journal, `rollback_from_journal`, the two rollback branches in the replacement loop, the
  `.old` parking files and the refuse-unless helpers around them — about 220 of the script's 527 logic lines (the other
  ~570 lines of the file are comments). Be honest about the size: the ~300 logic lines that remain are things any
  correct installer needs — target detection with the Rosetta case, prerequisite probing, latest-version discovery,
  `SHA256SUMS` handling, tar member validation, the `--version` cross-check, PATH and tmux advice, the closing messages
  — and `test-install-sh.sh` mostly tests THOSE (404, checksum mismatch, malformed archives, versions, prerequisites,
  the closing-message contract, the nothing-outside-`$INSTALL_DIR` diff); only the forced-failure rollback leg goes.
  Given up: a kill between the two macOS binaries' renames leaves one new and one old until the next run (the desktop
  shell finds its sibling by path, so a mismatch shows as a refusal, not silence), and a failure after placement no
  longer restores the previous binaries — re-run instead. A modest cut, worth taking when someone is in the file anyway
  rather than on its own.

- Fly.io Sprites as a host kind: a session backed by a per-second-billed microVM that freezes when idle, with "pause
  this host" in the UI meaning "stop paying for it". Assessed 2026-08-30 against a real sprite; the findings, the code
  mapping (a `HostKind::Sprite` over the existing ssh transport via the sprite CLI's ProxyCommand emulation, a
  provisioning flavor for a host with no systemd and no sftp, a `Paused` host state), the SPEC conflicts to surface, and
  a build order are in `lore/2026-08-30-fly-sprites-as-a-host-kind.md`. The same entry sizes the related "native app
  attaches to a remote helm" mode and the cheaper installed-web-app alternative.

- Tensorlake sandboxes as a host kind: the same idea assessed 2026-09-01 against a real sandbox, in
  `lore/2026-09-01-tensorlake-sandboxes-as-a-host-kind.md`. Fits better than sprites — a real SSH gateway makes the
  transport farhelm's existing ssh path with zero code changes (binary stdio and sftp both verified), suspend/resume
  preserves running processes under the same boot id, and platform-managed processes replace the missing systemd — at
  the cost of resume needing an explicit `tl sbx resume` (plain ssh refuses a suspended sandbox) and, today, an sshd
  session leak that defeats idle-suspend until the leaked sessions are reaped (evidence in the lore entry; worth
  reporting upstream).

## Unbucketized

- Make the never-started verdict say which link died. When a scoped launch dies before farhelm's exec shim, the
  supervisor's `wrapper_failure_detail` (launch_artifacts.rs) records "the agent was never started: the launch never
  reached farhelm's exec shim, so something before it — the transient cgroup scope wrapper, or the login shell itself —
  exited first", which names two suspects and separates neither. The wrapper's stderr is still sitting in the dead pane
  under `remain-on-exit`, so a `capture-pane` at classification time could say which. A first attempt (2026-08-23)
  appended the pane's last words to the durable `LastOutcome::Error` detail and was withdrawn in review for three
  reasons any retry must design around: (1) SPEC.md's terminal-retention contract — terminal content lives only as long
  as the host-side terminal, with no separate history store — which a durable excerpt of startup/rc output contradicts,
  so either the quote must not be persisted (log it, or surface it only while the pane exists) or the spec must
  authorize a bounded exception first; (2) the pane is reused across relaunches and keeps its scrollback, so a
  generation N+1 that died before printing anything would quote generation N's conversation unless the capture is fenced
  to text written after the wrapper started; (3) the ownership-and-deadness check and the capture are separate steps
  with no lifecycle claim across them on the list path, so a same-pane restart in between would quote a live later
  generation — revalidate atomically with the capture, and budget the capture so N never-started rows cannot cost N tmux
  timeouts on the hot list. The e2e harness already has `wait_for_agent_ready` (harness.rs), whose failure text shows
  the same pane text for a test's own diagnosis; that is the non-durable shape to start from.

- Decide the reservation tombstone scope for interactive creates, then do the work the verdict leaves standing. When a
  client attaches an intent key to a create, the supervisor records it in `create_reservations` so a retried request
  returns the already-created session instead of double-launching an agent. The durability-era decision made these
  reservations PERMANENT for interactive creates (spawn's are session-bounded), which makes `create_reservations` the
  only store table that grows without bound — every interactive create ever made adds a row nothing deletes. Two
  follow-on debts, deliberately distinct: (a) digest the reservation fingerprint — rows currently retain enough of the
  original request to match retries, i.e. request plaintext (titles, cwds, invocations) retained forever; hashing bounds
  each row and ends the plaintext retention but does nothing about row count; (b) expiry/pruning — actually bounds the
  count, at the deliberate cost that a pruned key becomes reusable after the horizon (a very late retry could
  double-create). The digest half is worth doing under either verdict. If the verdict bounds the scope (session-lifetime
  — defensible, since a retry outliving the session it protects is protecting nothing), the pruning half mostly
  evaporates; that reverses a durability-milestone decision, so record the reversal where that decision lives. The store
  module's own docs describe both debts.

- Run the review-cap residue pass: one targeted review (test-quality and docs lenses only) over the three largest M7
  surfaces — auth, provisioning, packaging. During the M7 stack's reviews, the test-quality lens (often docs too) was
  still producing ACCEPTED findings at the hard three-pass cap on every large PR (#114, #115, #117, #118, #119/#120,
  #121, #122, #123) — those reviews ended because the budget ran out, not because the reviewers ran dry, so there are
  almost certainly real accepted-grade findings never surfaced in security-critical code. Treat a pass that returns zero
  accepted findings as saturation finally reached; anything it does return gets the normal fix-or-reject treatment.
  Cheap to run, and the difference between "reviewed until done" and "reviewed until the meter ran out" — do it before
  declaring the first real release final.

- Close the HostId-reuse create-default window. The create dialog defaults its host field to the selected session's host
  BY ROW ID, but a host row id survives a retarget (or an adopt where a new install takes over) while the machine behind
  it changes: look at a session on the old machine, have the row retargeted, open the create dialog within one
  listing-refresh interval, and the create lands on the successor install. The request's own install-incarnation check
  passes — the request was genuinely built against the successor — so the system does what it was told while the user's
  intent lands on the wrong machine. Raised as a definite security finding in #156's review; accepted there as residual
  because selection reconciliation already narrows the window to one refresh interval. The full fix: the helm's listing
  must denormalize install identity per session so the client binds its create default to the install the user was
  actually looking at, not the row id. Not urgent (needs a concurrent retarget plus a one-interval race), but "accepted
  residual" should not quietly become "permanent".

- Run the manual Mac checklist (`docs/manual-mac-checklist.md` — that file IS the record; its "Observed:" fields are the
  state, all "not run"). Blocked on a human with a real Mac. Not covered by any CI: Playwright's WebKit is not
  WKWebView.

- Decide whether several helms sharing one supervisor becomes supported, and what that requires. SPEC.md says concurrent
  helms are unsupported in v1, with the supervisor's one-attachment-per-session rule as the only backstop. Observed on
  2026-08-27 while acceptance-testing the 0.1.0 rc: a desktop helm (0.1.0-rc.1) and the browser helm (0.0.3) both
  registered the same host and both listed the same sessions, live, with no disconnects, and switching between the two
  surfaces worked. That is not luck — sessions, their status and `archived` are supervisor-owned and the helm's
  `session_cache` is an explicit mirror, so any helm reaching the supervisor sees the same list. What was deliberately
  NOT tested: opening the SAME session in both helms. The expected result is the displaced-client path the spec defines
  for a second client (snapshot plus take-control, and auto-reconnect never seizing), since the supervisor enforces that
  rule, but the path has only ever been exercised between two clients of one helm. Known gaps before this could be
  called supported: (1) D2 version coupling — each helm expects the supervisor at its OWN version and offers `update`
  otherwise, so helms of different versions would tug the host up and down (the rc helm already offered to "update" the
  0.0.3 production supervisor; a compatibility rule such as "at least mine" plus a protocol version is design work, not
  a fix); (2) no lock against two helms provisioning or updating the same host at once; (3) the cross-helm takeover,
  replay-after-takeover and dimension handoff have no tests; (4) SPEC.md and SPEC_impl.md would need to state the
  supported model. Same-version helms look like a small step; mixed versions are the real work. First action when
  returning: run the untested case with two same-version helms and record what the displaced side shows.
