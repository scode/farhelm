# Changelog

Notable user-facing changes in each stable release of Farhelm. Release candidates and dev builds are not listed; their changes appear under the stable release that follows them. Entries are written for someone running Farhelm, not for someone reading its source, so internal mechanics are left out unless they change what you have to do. cargo-dist copies each release's section into its GitHub release; `releasing/AGENTS.md` describes the format and how a section is written.

## v0.12.0 - 2026-09-21

### ✨ Highlights

#### The session launcher looks like the rest of Farhelm

Previously the session launcher had a considerably different look and feel from the rest of Farhelm. It now uses the same colors, corners, and selection style as the main window, and its list of recent setups shows only what each one changes from the defaults. (#819, #820)

### 🔄 Changed

- The session launcher uses the main window's colors, corners, and selection style, and its recent-setup rows show only what each setup changes from the defaults. (#819, #820)

### 🔧 Fixed

- Buttons, inputs, and selects in the session launcher render in Farhelm's typeface instead of the platform's sans-serif. (#818)
