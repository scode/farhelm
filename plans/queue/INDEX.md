# Plans queue

One line per plan that has not landed, in queue order, oldest first. `plans/AGENTS.md` describes the states; only `scripts/plans-queue.py` changes them, and planning PRs add new `[pending]` lines, at the end unless the maintainer places them elsewhere. A landed plan moves to `plans/REPORTS.md` until the maintainer has reviewed its report. This file is excluded from dprint so a line is never rewrapped.

- [complete] `launcher-fixes.md` — New-session dialog fixes: retry key after a template resets permissions, Launch after a repository pick, the setup field after the folder is cleared, custom flags kept on a model choice, and the active repository suggestion kept visible (5 outcomes, each gated)
